Hello, peer-reviewers from IBM!

I'm [Cariad Eccleston on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learner/cariad). The URL of this repository should be [https://github.com/cariad/e-plantShopping](https://github.com/cariad/e-plantShopping), and note the account username: [@cariad](https://github.com/cariad).

If you're reviewing this repository on behalf of someone who _isn't_ Cariad Eccleston, please report the submission as plagiarised.

The cheaters on our course are not smart. They've been ripping me off for months. They've been filing false plagiarism reports against me. I always win, and they always lose, because I won't let them cheat their way into a career that the rest of us are working hard for.
